## Evaluation of Mutual Information between Summary Statistics and Physical Parameters

This repository provides a detailed implementation of the paper [Evaluating Summary Statistics with Mutual Information for Cosmological Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04994).

In this research, we study the application of mutual information to assess the effectiveness of various summary statistics in cosmological inference. Our approach utilizes the Barber-Agakov lower bound and normalizing flow based variational distributions. Additionally, we have implemented other mutual information estimators from papers such as [On Variational Bounds of Mutual Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06922), [Understanding the Limitations of Variational Mutual Information Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06222), and more.
